# SnapVibes - Image Gallery Project

## Overview
**SnapVibes** is a modern and interactive image gallery web application. It features a responsive layout, dynamic image fetching, and an elegant lightbox for viewing high-resolution images. The project is designed to deliver a seamless browsing experience across all devices.

## Features
- **Dynamic Image Loading**: Automatically fetches and displays a collection of images from an external source.
- **Fully Responsive Design**: Adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Lightbox Viewer**: Allows users to view images in full size with smooth navigation (next, previous, and close functionality).
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle hover animations enhance the user experience.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works on all major browsers.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: For responsive styling, animations, and fonts.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For dynamic content and user interaction.
- **Picsum API**: For fetching random images.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/noreenfatima775/CodeAlpha_Image-Gallery.git   ```
2. **Open in Browser**:
   Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## Project Structure
```
snapvibes/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html       # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css        # Styling for the gallery
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js        # JavaScript for interactivity
â”œâ”€â”€ logo.png         # Logo for the project
â”œâ”€â”€ preview.png       # Preview of the project
â””â”€â”€ README.md        # Documentation
```

## How It Works
1. **Dynamic Image Fetching**:
   - Loads 60 random images from `https://picsum.photos`.
   - Thumbnails are displayed in a responsive gallery grid.
2. **Responsive Layout**:
   - The grid layout adapts automatically to the screen size.
   - On smaller devices, fewer images are displayed per row to maintain readability.
3. **Lightbox Viewer**:
   - Click any image to view it in a full-screen lightbox.
   - Navigate between images using the on-screen controls.
